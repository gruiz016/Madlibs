# Flask Madlibs

In this exercise, I used Flask to make a very simple Madlibs game.

In Madlibs, youâ€™re asked a series of questions, like this:

plural_noun: turnips
verb: juggle

Those are then plugged into a story template, like this:

I love to {verb} {plural_noun}.
To create a story like:

I love to juggle turnips.
